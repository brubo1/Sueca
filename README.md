I'm mostly doing this for fun. I also wanted to learn how to make an android app.

EDIT: It was funny to know that I can still program in Java. I'll use MVC for this program

EDIT: After 8 hours, It was time to stop. There is no point in going further. Placing buttons takes time and I would not learn much more from this.
